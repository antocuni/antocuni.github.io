# What is Open Source?

---

## Definitions

- **Open Source Software (OSS)**

  - Source code is publicly available

  - Licensed to allow use, modification, distribution

- **Free Software**

  - Freedom to run, study, share, modify

  - "Free as in freedom, not as in beer"

- **FOSS / FLOSS**

  - Free/Libre Open Source Software

---

## Licenses

- Permissive licenses

  - MIT, BSD, Apache 2.0

  - Do whatever you want (almost)

- Copyleft licenses

  - GPL, LGPL, AGPL

  - Derivative works must also be open

- Choose wisely: https://choosealicense.com/

---

## Open Source vs Open Governance

- **Open Source**: code is public

- **Open Governance**: decisions are made transparently

  - Who decides what features to add?

  - Who can merge pull requests?

  - How are maintainers chosen?

---

## Examples

- Linux kernel: open source, meritocratic governance

- Python: open source, governed by the PSF and Steering Council

- Many corporate projects: open source, closed governance

  - Code is public

  - Decisions made internally

---

# The social aspect

<h3 class="fragment"><i>OSS is more about people than code</i></h3>

---

## OSS citizens

- Users

- Contributors

- Maintainers

---

## TL;DR

# Be nice

---

## Be a good OSS citizen

- OSS as a series of kindnesses

> You could view everything in OSS as a kindness that someone has done for you and others.
> <footer>— <strong>Brett Cannon</strong></footer>
<!-- .element: class="quote-card" -->

---

> When someone in open source makes demands it's like the person passing through the

<!-- .element: class="quote-card" -->

---

> It's a kindness when you report a bug so that I have a chance to try and fix it. But
> just because you reported a bug doesn't mean I specifically owe you anything.  [...]
> So the idea that any open source project owes anyone anything is a misunderstanding of
> what open source fundamentally is.
> <footer>— <strong>Brett Cannon</strong></footer>
<!-- .element: class="quote-card" -->

---

> When you submit a change to something, I'm sure your intentions are good. [...] <br>
> Think of a contribution like a puppy: you might view it as this cute, wonderful thing you're
> giving me while I'm looking at it as over a decade of feeding, walking, and vet bills.
