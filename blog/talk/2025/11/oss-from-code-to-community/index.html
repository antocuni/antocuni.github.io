# What is Open Source?

---

## Definitions

- [The Open Source Definition](https://opensource.org/osd)

  - Licensed to allow use, modification, distribution

- [The Free Software Definition](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html.en)

  - Freedom to run, study, share, modify

  - "Free as in freedom, not as in beer"

- **FOSS / FLOSS**

  - Free/Libre Open Source Software

---

## Licenses

- Permissive licenses

  - MIT, BSD, Apache 2.0

  - Do whatever you want (almost)

- Copyleft licenses

  - GPL, LGPL, AGPL

  - Derivative works must also be open

- Choose wisely: https://choosealicense.com/

---

## Open Source vs Open Governance

- **Open Source**: code is public

- **Open Governance**: decisions are made transparently

  - Who decides what features to add?

  - Who can merge pull requests?

  - How are maintainers chosen?

---

## Examples

- Linux kernel: open source, meritocratic governance

- Python: open source, governed by the PSF and Steering Council

- Many corporate projects: open source, closed governance

  - Code is public

  - Decisions made internally

---

## Code of Conduct

- Sets expectations for behavior

- Protects contributors from harassment

- Makes the project welcoming

- Python: https://www.python.org/psf/conduct/

---


# The social aspect

<h3 class="fragment"><i>OSS is more about people than code</i></h3>

---

## OSS citizens

- Users

- Contributors

- Maintainers

---

## TL;DR

# Be nice

---

## Be a good OSS citizen

- [Setting expectations for open source participation](https://snarky.ca/setting-expectations-for-open-source-participation/)

- [Video](https://youtu.be/tzFWz5fiVKU?t=48m55s)

- Brett Cannon's Keynote @ PyCon US 2018

- OSS as a series of kindnesses

> You could view everything in OSS as a kindness that someone has done for you and others.

---

> When someone in open source makes demands it's like the person passing through the

---

> It's a kindness when you report a bug so that I have a chance to try and fix it. But
> just because you reported a bug doesn't mean I specifically owe you anything.  [...]
> So the idea that any open source project owes anyone anything is a misunderstanding of
> what open source fundamentally is.

---

> When you submit a change to something, I'm sure your intentions are good. [...] <br>

# The OSS Contribution Workflow

---

## Overview

1. Find something to work on

2. Open an issue (if needed)

3. Fork & clone

4. Make your changes

5. Submit a Pull Request

6. Code review

7. Merge!

---

## Step 0: read guideline!

- `CONTRIBUTING.md`

---

## Step 1: Find something to work on

- Find a bug :)

- Browse the issue tracker

- Look for `good first issue` labels

- Ask the maintainers / community

---

## Step 2: Open an issue (if needed)

- Describe the bug or feature

- Check if it's already reported

- Wait for maintainer feedback

- Sometimes you can skip this for obvious bugs

---

## How to write a good issue

- Bad: https://github.com/qwertyquerty/pypresence/issues/65

- Good: https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/28957

- [Writing Great GitHub Issues for Open Source Projects: A Newbie's Guide
](https://dev.to/usooldatascience/writing-great-github-issues-for-open-source-projects-a-newbies-guide-2c4d?)

---

## Step 3: Fork the repository

- Click "Fork" on GitHub

- Creates a copy under your account

- You have full control over your fork

---

## Step 4: Clone & setup

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/project.git
cd project

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL/project.git

# Create a branch
git checkout -b fix-unicode-paths
```

---

## Step 5: Make your changes

```bash
# Make your changes
emacs path/to/file.py

# Run the tests
pytest

# Add your changes
git add path/to/file.py

# Commit
git commit -m "Fix Unicode handling in os.path.join on Windows"
```

---

## Step 6: Push to your fork

```bash
# Push to your fork
git push origin fix-unicode-paths
```

- GitHub will show a banner to create a PR

---

## Step 7: Open a Pull Request

- Write a clear description

- Reference the issue: "Fixes #1234"

- Explain what you changed and why

---

## Good PR description

```markdown
Fixes #1234

## Changes
- Modified os.path.join() to properly handle Unicode paths
- Added test case for Unicode path handling on Windows

## Testing
- All existing tests pass
- New test added: test_unicode_paths()
- Tested manually on Windows 10

## Notes
The issue was in the encoding assumption. Changed to
use UTF-8 explicitly instead of default encoding.
```

---

## Step 8: Code review

- Maintainer reviews your code

- Might request changes

- Be patient and respectful

- Respond to feedback promptly

---

## Responding to review feedback

```bash
# Make the requested changes
emacs path/to/file.py

# Run tests again
pytest

# Commit the changes
git add path/to/file.py
git commit -m "Address review feedback: add error handling"

# Push to the same branch
git push origin fix-unicode-paths
```

- The PR updates automatically

---

## Step 9: Merge!

- Once approved, maintainer merges

- Your code is now part of the project

- Congratulations, you're a contributor!

---

## Tips for successful contributions

- Start small

- Follow the project's style

- Write tests

- Be responsive to feedback

- Don't take rejection personally

---

  - How to set up development environment

  - How to run tests

  - Code style expectations

  - How to submit PRs

- **Good first issue** labels

---

## Tests!

- "What is not tested is broken"

- Makes it easy to accept contributions

- Prevents regressions

- Python: pytest → https://pytest.org/

---

<img src="tdd-by-example.jpg" width="30%">

---

## Continuous Integration (CI)

- Automate testing on every commit/PR

- GitHub Actions → https://docs.github.com/en/actions

- Run tests on multiple config (OS, Python version, release/debug, etc.)

---

## Formatters & Linters

- **Black** → https://github.com/psf/black

  - "The uncompromising code formatter"

  - Opinionated, consistent

- **Ruff** → https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff

  - Extremely fast linter + formatter

  - Replaces flake8, isort, and more

---

## Pre-commit hooks

- Run checks before committing

- Enforce formatting, linting automatically

- https://pre-commit.com/

```yaml
# .pre-commit-config.yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit
	rev: v0.8.4
	hooks:
	  - id: ruff
	  - id: ruff-format
```

---

## Project templates

- Get started quickly with best practices

- **cookiecutter** → https://www.cookiecutter.io/

- Many Python templates available

  - https://github.com/audreyfeldroy/cookiecutter-pypackage

  - https://github.com/scientific-python/cookie

---

## Communication channels

  - GitHub Issues

- **Discussions / Forums**

  - GitHub Discussions

  - Discourse

- **Chat**

  - Discord, Slack, Matrix

  - Real-time communication

---

## Small projects vs community

- Starting small is fine!

  - Just you, solving your problem

  - README + tests + CI = good start

- As it grows:

  - Add CONTRIBUTING.md

  - Set up discussions/chat

  - Be responsive (when you can)

  - Add co-maintainers

---

## Starting small

[SPy repo](https://github.com/spylang/spy/tree/f76c727130605568bebdf18f4e930310429548a1) on 6th Feb, 2025

  <img class="fragment" src="spy-README-history.png" />

---

## From code to community

- Start with code

- Add documentation

- Make it easy to contribute

- Be welcoming and kind

- Build trust

- **Community emerges naturally** (maybe 🤷‍♂️)

---

## Bonus section

<h1 class="fragment">What about AI?</h1>

---

<img src="to-ai-or-not-to-ai.png" width="30%" />

---

# Using AI is a skill

- AI is here to stay

- Programmers are/will be expected to know how to use it effectively

- `claude code`, `aider`, `codex`, ...

- Cursor, Windsurft, vscode+copilot, ...

- ChatGPT/claude web interface

---

# Relying on AI is a liability

- If you are not smarter than ChatGPT, why should I hire you?

- ChatGPT: **very** good up to a certain point

  - --> very good to solve your problems **now**

- Quick transition from "very good" to "almost useless"

- Invest on your **debugging** and **problem analyis** skills!

  - spending a night to debug a (silly) issue is priceless

  - you **must** develop this skill on easy problem

  - you will need it on harder problems

---

# OSS is an opportunity

- Anecdotally, less junior jobs

- Everybody wants to hire seniors

  * ==> shortage of mid/seniors in the next future

- OSS is a perfect way to gain experience

---

# Make a career in OSS

---

## My story

- 2006-2010: Master + PhD thesis on PyPy

- 2010-2020: Freelancing/consulting on PyPy + small OSS grants

- 2020-2022: 50% HPy grant from Oracle + 50% job @ Quansight

- 2022-now: full time job @ Anaconda

- 2006-now: **many** talks @ PyCons, many unfounded OSS work

  * Created "my personal brand"

---

## Pros & cons

Pros:

  - It's fun!

  - I traveled a lot

  - Made **tons** of friends and connections

	* "beer driven recruiting"

  - Made decent money

Cons:

  - Inconsistent income for many years

  - Arrived late in a more formal company setting
