<html><body><p>As happened in the last years, there will be a PyPy sprint just after
<a class="reference" href="https://www.europython.org/">EuroPython</a>.  The sprint will take place in the same hotel as the
conference, from 10th to 12th of July.</p>
<p>This is a fully public sprint: newcomers are welcome, and on the first
day we will have a tutorial session for those new to PyPy development.</p>
<p>Some of the topics we would like to work on:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>try out Python programs and fix them or fix PyPy or fix performance bottlenecks</li>
<li>some JIT improvement work</li>
<li>port the stackless transform to ootypesystem</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, other topics are also welcome.</p>
